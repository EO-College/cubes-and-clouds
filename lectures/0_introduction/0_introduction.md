# Introduction
This short sections will familiarize you with some free external services that are going to be used throughout the MOOC. 
- How to sign up for the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (this is where the cloud processing will happen)
- First steps in the Coding Environment
  
## Sign up for EO College
In case you haven't already done it. Sign up for the MOOC **'Cubes &amp; Clouds - Cloud Native Open Data Sciences for Earth Observation'**
- https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds

## Sign up for Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem
We are going to use the cloud processing platform **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem** to carry out our exercises. It's a cloud platform hosted by the European Commission, ESA and Copernicus.The processing will happen there and you will get 1000 free credits. That's enough to complete the course.

## Your first steps in the Coding Environment
Here is a guide how to find your way around in the Coding Environment JupyterHub. You will see a button that forwards you there whenever there is a hands-on exercise to do.
