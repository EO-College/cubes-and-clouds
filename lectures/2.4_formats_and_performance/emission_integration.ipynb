    "This notebook demonstrates 2 ways to integrate `codecarbon` into the exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the `@track_emissions` decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the `CustomEmissionsTracker` class\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to some limitations of the `codecarbon` library the base emission tracker has been extended to provide better control over writing the data of each experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done purely for the course reasons, and there is not added functionality which is not already present in the `codecarbon` library. I decided to do it this way to streamline the process for the students and to make sure we can have consistent and correct data representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CustomEmissionsTracker` class is a subclass of the `EmissionsTracker` class from the `codecarbon` library. It provides the same functionality as the base class, but it also allows for writing the data to a file after each experiment. This is useful for the course, as we can track the emissions of each experiment separately. It is a bit sketchy and incosistent doing it the codecarbon way, but it is the best way to do it for now."

    "Offline tracking requires the use of `country_iso_code` and `log_level` controls how much is printed in the output\n",

    "\n",
    "https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/methodology.html\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mode the tracker supports setting up custom `experiment_id`. This is part of the custom class which is appending it to the experiment csv. This makes the data collection a lot more consistent as sometimes the tracker doesnt write to file as required etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you run the first tracking, a CSV should be automatically created in the same directory. The CSV will contain the emissions data for the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "`codecarbon` has a list of supported CPUs for which it knows the power consumption. I noticed during testing on EoXhub that the CPU is not known:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[codecarbon WARNING @ 14:56:23] We saw that you have a AMD EPYC 7R13 Processor but we don't know it. Please contact us.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in that case `default_cpu_power` needs to be set to a value in Watts. The default value is 42.5W which is too low for server CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `default_cpu_power` is power_constant x consumption_percentage_constant according to the docs [here](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/parameters.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 7R13 has a TDP of 225W and 48 cores. However, each user is given 4.5 cores, so the power consumption should be around 225W / 48 * 4.5 = 21.09W. We use 4.5 instead of 4 as power/core is not fully linear. This is a rough estimate, but it should be close enough.\n",
    "\n",
