# Lectures
This is the place where the content of the lectures is stored. Every lecture has its own folder. 

## Structure
In the lectures folder there is 
- Markdown File: The main markdown file compiling all the information that will be displayed in the course. 
- Assets: A folder called `assests`. It holds all media used in the lecture, e.g. images, videos, interactive graphics, code snippets, etc.
- Exercises: If there are coding exercises in a lesson, the according notebooks and data are stored here.
