The validation procedure hence needs to be carefully communicated alongside the predictions. The resulting EO product (i.e. the prediction map) should be limited to the area for which the model was enabled to learn about relationships and for which performance estimates can be reliably provided for. This can be done by either masking the map or by providing an additional quality layer.","position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":1},"end":{"line":71,"column":1}},"key":"nyhwNHDbMJ"}],"key":"QINaB9UjmQ"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":1},"end":{"line":73,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"link","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvNsXDbz_W4","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":1},"end":{"line":73,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"image","url":"/cubes-and-clouds/build/8421c29ddc2659847fa748788d90ce10.jpeg","alt":"The validation of large scale mapping products","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":1},"end":{"line":73,"column":1}},"key":"a6kN5In1WC","urlSource":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZvNsXDbz_W4/0.jpg"}],"urlSource":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvNsXDbz_W4","key":"qNDDV6jklw"},{"type":"break","key":"J2ZW0uOhsQ"}],"key":"LSe7Y1Zep6"},{"type":"blockquote","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":1},"end":{"line":75,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":1},"end":{"line":75,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Video content in cooperation with ","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":1},"end":{"line":74,"column":1}},"key":"JNsOcVOBuk"},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.uni-muenster.de/RemoteSensing/team/meyer/index.html","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":1},"end":{"line":74,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Hannah Meyer","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":1},"end":{"line":74,"column":1}},"key":"qxeD7u3yrE"}],"urlSource":"https://www.uni-muenster.de/RemoteSensing/team/meyer/index.html","key":"dNn8LjbWei"},{"type":"text","value":" (University of Münster).
