# Cubes and Clouds
This is the official content repository for the online course ['Cubes &amp; Clouds - Cloud Native Open Data Sciences for Earth Observation'](https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds) hosted on EO College.

## Description
The Massive Open Online Course **'Cubes &amp; Clouds - Cloud Native Open Data Sciences for Earth Observation'** teaches the concepts of data cubes, cloud platforms and open science in the context of earth observation.

### Target Group
It targets Earth Science students and researchers who want to increase their technical capabilities onto the newest standards in EO computing, as well as Data Scientists who want to dive into the world of EO and apply their technical background to a new field.  Before starting, prerequisites are a general knowledge of EO and python programming.

### Content
The course explains the concepts of data cubes, EO cloud platforms and open science by applying them to a typical EO workflow from data discovery, data processing up to sharing the results in an open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) way. An engaging mixture of videos, animated content, lectures, hands-on exercises and quizzes transmits the content.

### Learning Objectives
After finishing the participant will understand the theoretical concepts of cloud native EO processing and have gained practical experience by conducting an end-to-end EO workflow. The participant will be capable of independently using cloud platforms to approach EO related research questions and be confident in how to share research by adhering to the concepts of open science.

## Interactive Cubes and Clouds Map produced by the participants
Check out the interactive cubes and clouds map! It's produced by the participants of the course. Every XXX adds their contribution to a community mapping project: mapping the snow cover of mountainous regions together!
